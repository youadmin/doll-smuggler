# knapsack

This is a version of the knapsack solution in clojure. The method produces a powerset of all item paths and determines the best collection based on value total for a given weight restriction.



## Usage

Build system is leiningen

To process the example set in {projectDir/knapsack}/inputs/dolls.txt, with a sack weight restriction of 400:

lein clean
lein deps
lein compile
lein run -m knapsack.core "inputs/dolls.txt" 400


or via jar...
lein clean
lein deps
lein uberjar
java -jar knapsack-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar "inputs/dolls.txt" 400

To Test: 
lein test

Currently the application simply prints out the recommended items for the knapsack.
